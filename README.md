# what-todo-python
This is a ToDo app written in Python.  This will likely be a command-line based interface as I've already completed a ToDo app [as a web application](../../what-todo-django). 

### With this project I'd like to:

*  gain a broader understanding of how to build a command-line interface 
* build my own data interface (rather than use a relational database)
* think through the module and abstraction architecture without relying on the opinions of a framework.

### Ideas to take this project further
* encrypt the data
* think about how to accommodate multiple users
	* perhaps have some sort of authorization and/or authentication	

## Requirements
#### This project requires [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
If you don't have Poetry installed, run:

`curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`

## SetUp
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into the project root directory.
2. `poetry install`
